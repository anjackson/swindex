Software Index

Idea is to use Solr to make searchable indexes of software from various sources.

Starting with NIST NSRL
* Take the RDS and index it
* Add http://web.archive.org/web/20130525234644/http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/morealgs.htm including ssdeep ngrams
* Add http://web.archive.org/web/20130526023312/http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/Diskprints.htm
* May include other data, http://web.archive.org/web/20130929225803/http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/

Also use tools to index software held at IA, mergeing the other information source in to allow cross-references, and to track software over time, across sources, and to build signatures.
